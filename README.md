# Frame Templates Generator

This project takes a URL (Storymap, Experience, Tableau, other) and other information and generates a single index.html file with government headers and footers, with the URL in an iFrame in between, giving you a website compliant with the USGS Visual identity guidelines for websites. 

Also includes templates for Geoplatform and National Park Service.
